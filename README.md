# numerical_methods

There are several numerical methods;

- To find derivative of a function (Backward, Central, and Forward Methods)
- To find roots of a function (Bisection, Newton, Secant Methods, and Regula Falsi)
- To find the solution vector for Ax = b matrix form (Gauss Seidel Method (It can be easily converted to Jacobian Method))
- Methods for Differential Equations (Euler, Midpoint, Heun (Without Iteration!) Methods)
